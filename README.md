# Car Dealer

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Running the Application

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install

Then, run the development server:

npm run dev

bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying [`src/app/page.js`](src/app/page.js). The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
